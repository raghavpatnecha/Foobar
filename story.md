## Welcome
<img src="https://github.com/raghavpatnecha/Foobar/blob/master/screenshot/welcome.png">
Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space station. From here, you just might be able to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...

## LEVEL 1
Start
<img src="https://github.com/raghavpatnecha/Foobar/blob/master/screenshot/lvl1_st.png">
Next time Bunny HQ needs someone to infiltrate a space station to rescue prisoners, you’re going to tell them to make sure 'stay up for 48 hours straight scrubbing toilets' is part of the job description. It’s only fair to warn people, after all.

You survived a week in Commander Lambda's organization, and you even managed to get yourself promoted. Hooray! Henchmen still don't have the kind of security access you'll need to take down Commander Lambda, though, so you'd better keep working. Chop chop!

## LEVEL 2 
Start

1) First Half

At least all this time spent running errands all over Commander Lambda's space station have given you a really good understanding of the station's layout. You'll need that when you're finally ready to destroy the LAMBCHOP and rescue the bunny prisoners.

2) Second Half

The latest gossip in the henchman breakroom is that "LAMBCHOP" stands for "Lambda's Anti-Matter Biofuel Collision Hadron Oxidating Potentiator". You're pretty sure it runs on diesel, not biofuel, but you can at least give the commander credit for trying.

Awesome! Commander Lambda was so impressed by your efforts that she's made you her personal assistant. You'll be helping her directly with her work, which means you'll have access to all of her files-including the ones on the LAMBCHOP doomsday device. This is the chance you've been waiting for. Can you use your new access to finally topple Commander Lambda's evil empire?

## LEVEL 3
Start

1) First Part
<img src="https://github.com/raghavpatnecha/Foobar/blob/master/screenshot/lvl3st.png">
There are a lot of difficult things about being undercover as Commander Lambda's personal assistant, but you have to say, the personal spa and private hot cocoa bar are pretty awesome.

2) Second Part
<img src="https://github.com/raghavpatnecha/Foobar/blob/master/screenshot/lvl333.png">
Commander Lambda has six suits, three dress uniforms, four casual outfits, and one Dress-Uniform-For-Important-Speeches-Only. You know this because you've already had to take all of them to the dry cleaner's. Twice!

3) Third Part

Who the heck puts clover and coffee creamer in their tea? Commander Lambda, apparently. When you signed up to infiltrate her organization, you didn't think you'd get such an up-close and personal look at her more...unusual tastes.

End
<img src="https://github.com/raghavpatnecha/Foobar/blob/master/screenshot/lvl3en.png">

Excellent! You've destroyed Commander Lambda's doomsday device and saved Bunny Planet! But there's one small problem: the LAMBCHOP was a wool-y important part of her space station, and when you blew it up, you triggered a chain reaction that's tearing the station apart. Can you rescue the imprisoned bunnies and escape before the entire thing explodes?

### At this point you are asked to submit details to google recruiter.

## LEVEL 4
Start

1) First Half
<img src="https://github.com/raghavpatnecha/Foobar/blob/master/screenshot/lvl4st.png">
You're pretty sure that last CRASH-BANG-THUD noise was the Sector C central support column collapsing. At least there's nothing in Sector C except the clover and coffee creamer storage.

2) Second Half
<img src="https://github.com/raghavpatnecha/Foobar/blob/master/screenshot/lvl450.png">
Six thousand, seven hundred and forty-one, six thousand, seven hundred and forty-two, six thousand, seven hundred and forty-three... Good grief! Just how many bunnies has Commander Lambda captured?!

End
<img src="https://github.com/raghavpatnecha/Foobar/blob/master/screenshot/lvl4en.png">
Oh no! You escaped Commander Lambda's exploding space station - but so did she, and she's definitely not happy with you. She's chasing you in her heavily-armed starfighter, while you and your bunny refugees are stuck in these lumbering escape pods. It'll take all your wits and cleverness to escape such a hare-y situation, so you'd better hop to it!

## LEVEL 5
Start
<img src="https://github.com/raghavpatnecha/Foobar/blob/master/screenshot/lvl5st.png">
Your planned escape route - and your backup route, and your extra-backup route - have all been blocked by debris from the space station or Commander Lambda's starfighters. Your only remaining option is to try deep space, and to boldly go where no bunny has gone before.

End
<img src="https://github.com/raghavpatnecha/Foobar/blob/master/screenshot/lvl5_en.png">
With one last roar of the escape pod's engines, you and your bunny companions jump to lightspeed. Congratulations! You've destroyed the LAMBCHOP, rescued the bunnies, gotten Commander Lambda off your tail, and saved the galaxy. Time for a little rest and relaxation back on Bunny Planet. Pat yourself on the back - you've earned it!
